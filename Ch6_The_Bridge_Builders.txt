Chapter 6: The Bridge Builders

Sierra, enthralled by all the new content, made it her mission to start a series of videos teaching the basics of English to Douyin users, weaving her lessons into comedic skits. Within weeks, she found her popularity spiking. Her feed was flooded with Chinese comments—some in perfect English, some in pinyin, some in a mix of both. She discovered more than a few misconceptions about the U.S. that she could gently clarify. Before long, her followers were pointing her toward Chinese creators who posted English-learning videos. Those, in turn, helped her learn more Chinese phrases and cultural idioms.

Meanwhile, Yao, the college student in Beijing, started streaming live Q&A sessions in the early morning (late afternoon in the U.S.) so her new American followers could tune in. They’d ask about Chinese street food, musical preferences, or study habits. She’d respond with a mixture of jokes and genuine curiosity about life in the West, bridging the oceanic distance through that tiny phone screen.
