## Why this repo?

Reading #TikTok-refugee notes on Rednote has been a real rollercoaster of laughter and tears. It reminds me of the early Internet days, when distance and culture didn’t stand in the way of sharing our joys, challenges, and creativity. However, bad things happened and there have been things blocking us. Good news is that in 2025, the heartwarming moments are back!

And the rise of AI makes me wonder: how would an event like #TikTok-refugee look through an AI’s eyes?

So, I turned to GPT-o1 - a model trained before the #TikTok-refugee and unable to browse recent news - and asked it to write a novel based on that idea (not even mentioning the refugee sort of thing). It’s not perfect, but in many ways it resonates with what people around the world have gone through, and it has those heartwarming lines that remind us we’re all in this together.

Whatever the future holds, let’s at least live up to this AI’s hopeful vision.

And I created this repo to hold the text version of GPT generated novel.

Peace.
