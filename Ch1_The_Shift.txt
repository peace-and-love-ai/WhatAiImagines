Chapter 1: The Shift

There was a flicker of something new in the air—at least, that’s how seventeen-year-old Sierra Brooks felt. She tapped open what used to be her TikTok app, only to see that it had automatically switched to a new interface overnight. Bright Chinese characters greeted her. Once an effortless repository of dance challenges, comedic sketches, and quick cooking hacks, the platform was now Douyin. The content was still short-form videos, but its origins were undeniably different.

At first, Sierra shrugged. Everyone she knew was doing it. After the controversial ban on TikTok in the United States, social media creators discovered a workaround: simply download the Chinese version—Douyin—and keep on scrolling. It felt rebellious, even exciting. Like unlocking a foreign TV channel that no one else had thought to watch.
