Chapter 5: Connection Across Oceans

In Chicago, 23-year-old tech enthusiast James Torres began analyzing Douyin’s algorithms for an ambitious research project. He created a side-by-side comparison of the old TikTok feed with the new Douyin feed. His findings suggested that the content wasn’t actually being censored as severely as some Americans expected—at least not for the light-hearted, daily-life videos. Complex topics occasionally popped up only to vanish, leaving behind a new question: What existed beneath the surface of Douyin?

He connected with a Beijing-based data analyst named Lin who had been investigating the same phenomenon from the other side of the Great Firewall. After exchanging a series of late-night messages, the two decided to build a shared dashboard. Their goal: to trace viral videos’ pathways across language lines and see what rose to prominence in each culture. Along the way, they discovered an entire realm of similarities—universal humor, shared frustrations, the same bright spark of curiosity.
